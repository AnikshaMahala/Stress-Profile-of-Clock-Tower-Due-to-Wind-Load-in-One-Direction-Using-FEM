# Stress-Profile-of-Clock-Tower-Due-to-Wind-Load-in-One-Direction-Using-FEM
Developed in-house code in Matlab for calculating the plane stress and plane strain using Q4 elements.
Designed the part with Abaqus software, applied traction in one direction, analyzed the stress strain profile, and obtained a gmsh file.
Utilizing the nodes from the gmsh file, the numerical solutions for the stress and strain profiles were obtainedthrough the generated code, and both solutions were compared.
## Tools & technologies used:
- MATLAB
- Abaqus
- FEM
